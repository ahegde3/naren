/**
 * Problem Statement :
You are given a 2-D matrix A of n rows and m columns where A[i][j] denotes the calories burnt. Two persons, a boy and a girl,
start from two corners of this matrix. The boy starts from cell (1,1) and needs to reach cell (n,m). On the other hand, the girl starts
from cell (n,1) and needs to reach (1,m). The boy can move right and down. The girl can move right and up. As they visit a cell, the amount in
the cell A[i][j] is added to their total of calories burnt. You have to maximize the sum of total calories burnt by both of them under the condition
that they shall meet only in one cell and the cost of this cell shall not be included in either of their total.
